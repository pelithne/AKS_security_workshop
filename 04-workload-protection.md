# 4.0 Deploy app with Workload Identity

## 4.1 Introduction
Workload identity allows you to securely access Azure resources from your Kubernetes applications using Azure AD identities. This way, you can avoid storing and managing credentials in your cluster, and instead rely on the native Kubernetes mechanisms to federate with external identity providers.

Workload identity replaces the deprecated pod identity feature, and is the recommended way to manage identity for workloads. 

more information about workload identity can be found here: [Use Azure AD workload identity with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview?tabs=dotnet)


In this section, you will learn how to:

- Build an application and store it in Azure Container Registry
- Activate OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster (or create a new cluster with OIDC activated)
- Create a secret and store it in Azure Key Vault
- Create an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) managed identity
- Connect the managed identity to a Kubernetes service account with token federation
- Deploy a workload and verify authentication to Key Vault with the workload identity


## 4.2 Deployment
First, create some environment variables, to make life easier.


### 4.2.1 Prepare Environment Variables for infrastructure


> **_! Note:_** The Azure keyvault name is a global name that must be unique

````
FRONTEND_NAMESPACE="frontend"
BACKEND_NAMESPACE="backend"
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="workload-identity-sa"
SUBSCRIPTION="$(az account show --query id --output tsv)"
USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME="keyvaultreader"
FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME="keyvaultfederated"
KEYVAULT_NAME="<DEFINE A KEYVAULT NAME HERE>"
KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME="redissecret"
````

### 4.2.2 Update AKS cluster with OIDC issuer

Enable the existing cluster to use OpenID connect (OIDC) as an authentication protocol for Kubernetes API server (unless already done). This allows the cluster to integrate with Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) and other identity providers that support OIDC.

````bash
az aks update -g $RG -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME  --enable-oidc-issuer 

````

Get the OICD issuer URL. Query the AKS cluster for the OICD issuer URL with the following command, which stores the reult in an environment variable.

````bash
AKS_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME -g $RG  --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" -otsv)"
````

The variable should contain the Issuer URL similar to the following:
 ````https://eastus.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/9e08065f-6106-4526-9b01-d6c64753fe02/9a518161-4400-4e57-9913-d8d82344b504/````

### 4.2.3 Create Azure Keyvault

Create the Azure Keyvault instance. When creating the Keyvault, use "deny as a default" action for the network access policy, which means that only the specified IP addresses or virtual networks can access the key vault.

Your bastion host will be allowed, so use that one when you interact with Keyvault later.

````bash
az keyvault create -n $KEYVAULT_NAME -g $RG -l $LOCATION --default-action deny
````

Create a private DNS zone for the Azure Keyvault.

````bash
az network private-dns zone create --resource-group $RG --name privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net
````

Link the Private DNS Zone to the HUB and SPOKE Virtual Network

````bash
az network private-dns link vnet create --resource-group $RG --virtual-network $HUB_VNET_NAME --zone-name privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net --name hubvnetkvdnsconfig --registration-enabled false


az network private-dns link vnet create --resource-group $RG --virtual-network $SPOKE_VNET_NAME --zone-name privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net --name spokevnetkvdnsconfig --registration-enabled false
````

Create a private endpoint for the Keyvault

First we need to obtain the Keyvault ID in order to deploy the private endpoint.

````bash
KEYVAULT_ID=$(az keyvault show --name $KEYVAULT_NAME \
  --query 'id' --output tsv)
````
Create the private endpoint in endpoint subnet.

````bash
az network private-endpoint create --resource-group $RG --vnet-name $SPOKE_VNET_NAME --subnet $ENDPOINTS_SUBNET_NAME --name KVPrivateEndpoint --private-connection-resource-id $KEYVAULT_ID --group-ids vault --connection-name PrivateKVConnection --location $LOCATION
````

Fetch IP of the private endpoint and create an *A record* in the private DNS zone.

Obtain the IP address of the private endpoint NIC card.
 ````bash
KV_PRIVATE_IP=$(az network private-endpoint show -g $RG -n KVPrivateEndpoint \
  --query 'customDnsConfigs[0].ipAddresses[0]' --output tsv)
 ````

Create the A record in DNS zone and point it to the private endpoint IP of the Keyvault.

````bash
  az network private-dns record-set a create \
  --name $KEYVAULT_NAME \
  --zone-name privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net \
  --resource-group $RG
````
Point the A record to the private endpoint IP of the Keyvault.
````bash
 az network private-dns record-set a add-record -g $RG -z "privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net" -n $KEYVAULT_NAME -a $KV_PRIVATE_IP
 ````

Now, Navigate to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and enter your login credentials.

Once logged in, locate and select your **resource group** where the Jumpbox has been deployed. Within your resource group, find and click on the **Jumpbox VM**.


In the left-hand side menu, under the **Operations** section, select ‘Bastion’. Enter the **credentials** for the Jumpbox VM and verify that you can log in successfully.


Once successfully logged in to the jumpbox **login to Azure** if you have not already done so in previous steps.


In the command line type the following command and ensure it returns the **private ip address of the private endpoint**.

````bash
dig <KEYVAULT NAME>.vault.azure.net
````
Example output:
````bash
azureuser@Jumpbox-VM:~$ dig alibengtssonkeyvault.vault.azure.net

; <<>> DiG 9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.3-Ubuntu <<>> alibengtssonkeyvault.vault.azure.net

````


Now, you should have an infrastucture that looks like this:

![Screenshot](/images/hubandspokewithpeeringBastionJumpboxFirewallaksvirtualnetlinkandacrandinternalloadbalancerandapplicationgwandkeyvault.jpg)

 ### Add a secret to Azure Keyvault

 ### NOTE: Because the keyvault is isolated in a VNET, you need to access it from the jumphost. Please log in to the jump host, and set a few environment variables (or load all environment variables you stored in a file):

 ````
RG=AKS_Security_RG
LOCATION=westeurope 
FRONTEND_NAMESPACE="frontend"
BACKEND_NAMESPACE="backend"
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="workload-identity-sa"
SUBSCRIPTION="$(az account show --query id --output tsv)"
USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME="keyvaultreader"
FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME="keyvaultfederated"
KEYVAULT_NAME=<Your key vault name>
KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME="redissecret"
AKS_CLUSTER_NAME=private-aks
 ````

Now create a secret in the keyvault. This is the secret that will be used by the frontend application to connect to the (redis) backend.

 ````
 az keyvault secret set --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME --name $KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME --value 'redispassword'
 ````

### Add the Key Vault URL to the environment variable *KEYVAULT_URL*
 ````
 export KEYVAULT_URL="$(az keyvault show -g $RG  -n $KEYVAULT_NAME --query properties.vaultUri -o tsv)"
 ````

 ### Create a managed identity and grant permissions to access the secret

Create a User Managed Identity. We will give this identity *GET access* to the keyvault, and later associate it with a Kubernetes service account. 

 ````
 az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION 
 az identity create --name $USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME  --resource-group $RG  --location $LOCATION  --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION 

 ````

 Set an access policy for the managed identity to access the Key Vault

 ````
 export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group $RG  --name $USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME  --query 'clientId' -otsv)"

 az keyvault set-policy --name $KEYVAULT_NAME  --secret-permissions get --spn $USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID 
 ````


 ### Create Kubernetes service account

First, connect to the cluster if not already connected
 
 ````
 az aks get-credentials -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME -g $RG
 ````

#### Create service account

The service account should exist in the frontend namespace, because it's the frontend service that will use that service account to get the credentials to connect to the (redis) backend service.

> **_! Note:_** Instead of creating kubenetes manifest files, we will create them on the commandline like below. I a real life case, you would create manifest files and store them in a version control system, like git.


First create the frontend namespace

````
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: $FRONTEND_NAMESPACE
  labels:
    name: $FRONTEND_NAMESPACE
EOF
````

Then create a service account in that namespace. Notice the annotation for *workload identity*
````
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  namespace: $FRONTEND_NAMESPACE
  annotations:
    azure.workload.identity/client-id: $USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID
  name: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
EOF
````


### Establish federated identity credential

In this step we connect the Kubernetes service account with the user defined managed identity in Azure, using a federated credential.

````
  az identity federated-credential create --name $FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME --identity-name $USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RG --issuer $AKS_OIDC_ISSUER --subject system:serviceaccount:$FRONTEND_NAMESPACE:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
````

### Build the application

Now its time to build the application. In order to do so, first clone the applications repository:

````
git clone https://github.com/pelithne/az-vote-with-workload-identity.git
````

In order to push images, you may have to login to the registry first using your Azure AD identity: 
````
az acr login
````


Then run the following commands to build, tag and push your container image to the Azure Container Registry
````
cd cd az-vote-with-workload-identity
cd azure-vote 
sudo docker build -t azure-vote-front:v1 .
sudo docker tag azure-vote-front:v1 $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
sudo docker push $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1

````
The string after ````:```` is the image tag. This can be used to manage versions of your app, but in this case we will only have one version. 


### Deploy the application

We want to create some separation between the frontend and backend, by deploying them into different namespaces. Later we will add more separation by introducing network policies in the cluster to allow/disallow traffic between specific namespaces.


First, create the backend namespace

#### NOTE: instead of creating kubernetes manifest, we put them inline for convenience. Feel free to create yaml-manifests instead if you like

````
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: backend
  labels:
    name: backend
EOF
````



The create the Backend application, which is a Redis store which we will use as a "database". Notice how we inject a password to Redis using an environment variable (not best practice obviously, but for simplicity).
````
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back
  namespace: $BACKEND_NAMESPACE
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: azure-vote-back
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: azure-vote-back
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        "kubernetes.io/os": linux
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-back
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/bitnami/redis:6.0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
          name: redis
        env:
        - name: REDIS_PASSWORD
          value: "redispassword"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-back
  namespace: $BACKEND_NAMESPACE
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-back
EOF
````


Then create the frontend. We already created the frontend namespace in an earlier step, so ju go ahead and create the frontend app in the frontend namespace.

A few things worh noting:

````azure.workload.identity/use: "true"```` - This is a label that tells AKS that workload identity should be used

````serviceAccountName: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME```` - Specifies that this resource is connected to the service account created earlier

````image: $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/azure-vote:v1```` - The image with the application built in a previous step.

````service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4: $ILB_EXT_IP```` - This "hard codes" the IP address of the internal LB to match what was previously configured in App GW as backend.


````
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1

        env:
        - name: REDIS
          value: "azure-vote-back.backend"
        - name: KEYVAULT_URL
          value: $KEYVAULT_URL
        - name: SECRET_NAME
          value: $KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
  namespace: $FRONTEND_NAMESPACE
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet: "loadbalancer-subnet"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-front
EOF
````

### Validate the application
To test if the application is working, you can navigate to the URL used before to reach the nginx test application. This time the request will be redirected to the Azure Vote frontend instead. If that works, it means that the Azure Vote frontend pod was able to fetch the secret from Azure Keyvault, and use it when connecting to the backend (Redis) service/pod.

You can also verify in the application logs that the frontend was able to connect to the backend.

To do that, you need to find the name of the pod:
````
kubectl get pods ---namespace frontend
````
This should give a result timilar to this
````
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
azure-vote-front-85d6c66c4d-pgtw9   1/1     Running   29 (7m3s ago)   3h13m
````

Now you can read the logs of the application by running this command (but with YOUR pod name)
````
kubectl logs azure-vote-front-85d6c66c4d-pgtw9 --namespace frontend
````

You should be able to find a line like this:
````
Connecting to Redis... azure-vote-back.backend
````
And then a little later:
````
Connected to Redis!
````



### Network policies
The cluster is deployed with Azure network policies. The Network policies can be used to control traffic between resources in Kubernetes.

This first policy will prevent all traffic to the backend namespace. 

````
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-ingress-to-backend
  namespace: backend
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels: {}
EOF
````


Network policies are applied on new TCP connections, and because the frontend application has already created a persistent TCP connection with the backend it might have to be redeployed for the policy to hit. One way to do that is to simply delete the pod and let it recreate itself:

First find the pod name
````
kubectl get pods --namespace frontend
````
This should give a result timilar to this
````
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
azure-vote-front-85d6c66c4d-pgtw9   1/1     Running   29 (7m3s ago)   3h13m
````

Now delete the pod with the following command (but with YOUR pod name)

````
kubectl delete pod --namespace frontend azure-vote-front-85d6c66c4d-pgtw9
````

After the deletion has finished you should be able to se that the "AGE" of the pod has been reset.
````
kubectl get pods --namespace frontend

NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
azure-vote-front-85d6c66c4d-9wtgd   1/1     Running   0               25s
````

You should also find that the frontend can no longer communicate with the backend and that when accessing the URL of the app, it will time out.


Now apply a new policy that allows traffic into the backend namespace from pods that have the label ````app: azure-vote-front````

````
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-frontend
  namespace: backend # apply the policy in the backend namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: azure-vote-back # select the redis pod
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: frontend # allow traffic from the frontend namespace
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: azure-vote-front # allow traffic from the azure-vote-front pod
EOF
````

Once again you have to recreate the pod, so that it can establish a connection to the backend service. Or you can simply wait for Kubernetes to attemt to recreate the frontend pod. 


First find the pod name
````
kubectl get pods --namespace frontend
````

Then delete the pod (using the name of your pod)

````
kubectl delete pod --namespace frontend azure-vote-front-85d6c66c4d-pgtw9
````


This time, communication from azure-vote-front to azure-vote-back is allowed.
